Piranha Documentation
===================================

Piranha is a tool developed to help standardise and streamline sequencing of poliovirus. It's been developed by members of the Rambaut group at the University of Edinburgh as part of the [Poliovirus Sequencing Consortium](https://polio-nanopore.github.io/). Piranha runs an end-to-end read-to-report analysis that produces distributable, interactive reports alongside analysed consensus data. It produces an overall report, summarising the entire sequencing run, as well as a sample-specific report. Samples with virus of interest, such as VDPV are highlighted and certain quality-control flags can alert the user if there are issues with the run (such as a failed negative or positive control or identical sequences between samples that may be the result of contamination).
